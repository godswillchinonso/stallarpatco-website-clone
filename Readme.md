# Stallarpatco Website Clone

A fully responsive clone of [stallarpatcoltd.com](https://stallarpatcoltd.com), built as a **frontend challenge** to replicate the original design and user experience with precision.  

This project emerged from a friendly **UI/UX challenge** within my team — I wanted to demonstrate that, although I primarily specialize in **backend logic and API development**, I can also accurately recreate modern frontend designs from scratch.
